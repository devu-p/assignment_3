3. What is the difference between OOP and POP?

Procedure-oriented Programming(POP) and Object-oriented programming(OOP) both are the programming approaches, which uses high-level language for programming. 

A program can be written in both the languages, but if the task is highly complex, OOP operates well as compared to POP. 

In POP, the ‘data security’ is at risk as data freely moves in the program, as well as, ‘code reusability’ is not achieved which makes the programming lengthy, and hard to understand.
